Welcome to the official repository of **MDEC 2025**, the **4th Monocular Depth Estimation Challenge**, held at **CVPR 2025**.

This repository is forked from the original SYNS-Patches starter pack and has been updated with the latest advancements to support this year‚Äôs competition.

### ‚ö° What‚Äôs new in MDEC 2025?

- üìê **New prediction types**: The challenge became more accessible thanks to the added support of affine-invariant predictions. Metric and scale-invariant predictions are also automatically supported. Disparity predictions, which were supported in previous challenges, are also accepted. 

- ü§ó **Pre-trained Model Support**: We provide ready-to-use scripts for off-the-shelf methods: [Depth Anything V2](mdec_2025/depth_anything_v2/generate.py) (disparity) and [Marigold](mdec_2025/marigold_v1-0/generate.py) (affine-invariant). Adding new pre-trained methods is very easy.

- üìä **Updated Evaluation Pipeline:** The Codalab grader code has been [updated](src/core/evaluator.py) to accommodate the newly supported prediction types.

# Generating Results

First we must download the MDEC validation set zip file.

```bash
sh mdec_2025/download_syns_patches.sh 
```
This will generate a file called ```syns_patches.zip``` in the ```mdec_2025``` directory

Than we have to generate the results of running the model on those results.

```bash
pip install -r mdec_2025/requirements.txt
python mdec_2025/depth_anything_v2/generate.py --split "val"
```
This will install all necessary python packages and create a new file called ```pred_val.npz``` in the ```mdec_2025/depth_anything_v2``` directory. (This will take around 10 minutes on most laptops depending on hardware)

Finally, to visualize the results run this command with the indices of the desired images to visualize depth maps for.

```bash
python mdec_2025/depth_anything_v2/visualize.py --image_indices 0 1 2
```
This will display the images in a new window.
